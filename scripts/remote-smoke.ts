// actual Socket + RemoteBackend with no $lib resolution.
// Start a server first: BOITE_TOKEN=test BOITE_BIND=127.0.0.1:7399 boite-server.
//
// `BOITE_TOKEN` is the bootstrap credential and pairs a device; what the backend
// takes is that device's own credential, which it turns into a socket ticket
// itself. So this pairs a throwaway device first and revokes it at the end.
