 * Sharing one file would mean `bun run test` starting a dev window.
 *
 * One worker, no parallelism, no isolation between files: the scenarios share a
 * single dev window and the single `boite-mcp --dev` that owns it, and both of
 * those live on the worker's `globalThis`. Two workers would be two windows on
 * port 1430, and the second would find the port taken.
 *
 * `root` is spelled from this file's own URL rather than as `".."`: vitest
 * resolves a relative root against the working directory, which put it one
 * level above the repository and found no scenario at all.
