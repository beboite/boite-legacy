/**
 * A request answered in the approvals dock, with the chat pane out of the way.
 *
 * Written while both halves of that were broken, and it is what proves they are
 * not any more.
 *
 * 1. Nothing told the window that a chat thread had opened an approval row.
 *    `boite://approvals-changed` came from `src-tauri/src/agent_api.rs` alone,
 *    so `approvals.watch()` never fired for a `pilot.request` row and the dock
 *    stayed empty until the webview reloaded for some other reason. Both hosts
 *    now emit it off the projection that writes the row.
 * 2. The card then never resolved: `fromRows` rebuilt `items` and left
 *    `state.requests` empty, so `PilotApproval` looked its request id up, found
 *    nothing and drew "Loading". The list is rebuilt from the request rows,
 *    which is what its own comment promised.
 *
 * The three cases are one story and run in order: the pane opens the question
 * and goes away, the dock draws the same card, and the answer given there is
 * the answer on the row.
