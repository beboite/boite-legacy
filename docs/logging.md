# Logging

One log, four hosts, one clock. This is how to read it, and what it costs to
write to it.

The point of the whole thing is that "what happened to thread X" is one
question with one answer. Before it, the desktop wrote a flat file with no
thread in it, `boite-server` printed to a stderr nobody keeps, and `boite-mcp`
wrote nothing at all.

## Reading it as an agent

The `logs` MCP tool. Two actions:

- `action: "tail"` reads the last records the host still has in memory (2000 of
  them). Instant, no file read, and it only ever has this host's own records.
- `action: "query"` reads the files of every host in the log directory, current
  and rotated, and merges them on `ts`. The only way back past a restart.

Filters, the same on both the tool and the bus:

| Filter | What it does |
|---|---|
| `level` | This level and worse. `warn` answers warnings and errors. |
| `host` | `desktop`, `server`, `mcp` or `webview`. Omit for all four. |
| `thread` | One terminal, by thread id. Exact match. |
| `turn` | One agent turn. |
| `target` | A prefix of the Rust module path, so `boite_core` catches its children. |
| `text` | Case-insensitive, matched against the message and the fields. |
| `since`, `until` | Unix milliseconds, inclusive. |
| `limit` | Default 100, max 1000. `tail` is capped by the ring at 2000. |

### Three questions, worked

**What happened to thread X.** Everything any host said about that terminal, in
order, whichever host said it:

```
logs action=query thread=8f3a1c92-... limit=200
```

**Every warning of the last ten minutes.** `since` is a unix millisecond stamp;
`workspace_snapshot` carries a `takenAtMs` you can subtract from.

```
logs action=query level=warn since=<now - 600000>
```

**The spawn and the exit of every child.** Both are logged from
`boite_core::pty`, at `info`, with the pid:

```
logs action=query target=boite_core::pty text=pty. limit=200
```

A spawn reads `pty.spawned [thread=<id> pty=<id> pid=<pid> cwd=<dir> cmd=<argv>]`
and its exit reads `pty.exited [thread=<id> pty=<id> pid=<pid> code=<code>]`. The
`pty` id is what pairs the two.

## The record

One JSON object per line. The field names are single words and are the same in
the file, on the wire and in the tool's output:

```json
{"ts":1756000000000,"seq":12,"host":"server","level":"warn",
 "target":"boite_server::ws","msg":"rpc.failed",
 "thread":"t-7","device":"phone-1","span":"rpc",
 "fields":{"method":"git.commit","reason":"not a repository"}}
```

`ts` is unix milliseconds and `seq` is a per-process counter, so two records in
the same millisecond keep their order. `thread`, `turn`, `request` and `device`
are top level on purpose: a filter never has to parse `fields`.

Absent fields are absent rather than null, so a record with no ids is five keys
long.

## Where the files are

`<log dir>/<host>.jsonl`, rotated at **8 MB**, keeping **two** previous
generations (`<host>.1.jsonl`, `<host>.2.jsonl`). So one host costs at most
24 MB and always has at least 8 MB of history.

| Host | Log directory |
|---|---|
| `desktop` | The Tauri app log dir: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.boite.legacy\logs` on Windows, `~/Library/Logs/com.boite.legacy` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/com.boite.legacy/logs` elsewhere. |
| `server` | `--log-dir`, else `BOITE_LOG_DIR`, else the desktop directory above. |
| `mcp` | The same three, in the same order. A machine with no such directory logs nowhere rather than failing the sidecar. |
| `webview` | No file of its own: its records go through the bus (`logs.write`) and land in whichever host answered. |

They all default to one directory on purpose. That is what makes `query` a
merge rather than four separate reads.

## Writing to it, from Rust

The `tracing` macros, with the ids as fields:

```rust
tracing::info!(thread = %id, pid, "pty.spawned");
```

`thread`, `turn`, `request` and `device` are lifted to the top level of the
record, from the event or from any span around it, innermost span first. So a
caller that opens `bus.call{method, thread}` never repeats the thread on the
events inside it. Everything else lands in `fields`. The innermost span's name
lands in `span`.

The message is the first positional argument and reads best as an event name
(`pty.spawned`, `rpc.failed`) rather than a sentence: it is what `text=` matches
on, and a sentence with a path in it matches nothing twice.

## Level

`BOITE_LOG`, in `EnvFilter` syntax:

```
BOITE_LOG=warn                          everything at warn and worse
BOITE_LOG=info,boite_core::pty=debug     info, plus one target louder
BOITE_LOG=boite_server=debug,warn        one crate at debug, the rest at warn
```

With `BOITE_LOG` unset the default is `info`, plus `boite_pilot=debug` and
`boite_core::command=debug` in a debug build. A release build never turns those
on by itself.

`logs.level` on the bus reads it with no argument and sets it with
`directives`, without a restart. The whole directive, not one target:
`EnvFilter` cannot amend itself.

## Redaction

Applied on the way in, to `msg` and to every string field, so what is in the
file is already safe to paste into an issue:

- anything shaped like an address becomes `<email>`, the local part included:
  `firstname.lastname@` is a person;
- a directory that is the user's becomes the name of the variable that holds it
  (`%USERPROFILE%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `$HOME` and the others), so a reader still
  sees which directory it was without seeing whose.

## The bus

`logs.tail`, `logs.query`, `logs.level`, `logs.write`, `logs.subscribe`. The
reads and `logs.subscribe` need `read`; `logs.write` and `logs.level` need
`write`: a read-only device turning on `trace` costs every other device the
bytes.

`logs.subscribe` makes the server push `log.record` events at that device,
coalesced into batches of up to 50 records or every 250 ms. One event per record
would put a broadcast on the log's own write path.

## Writing to it, from the webview

`log` in `src/lib/shared/log.ts`, four levels and a `target` that reads like a
module path:

```ts
import { log } from "$lib/shared/log";

log.info("app.thread", "thread.created", { thread: id, project: projectId });
```

`fields` carries `thread`, `turn` and `request` as top-level record fields and
everything else under `fields`, exactly as the Rust side does. `host` is forced
to `webview` by whichever host answers, and so is `device` on the server: a
client says what happened, never who it was.

**Nothing goes out one line at a time.** Records are queued and flushed every
500 ms, at once when fifty are waiting, and on `pagehide`: a window going away
is when its last lines matter most. A flush that fails is dropped in silence,
because a line about a failed flush rides the next flush, which fails for the
same reason.

`src/lib/shared/services/logger.svelte.ts` is a shim over the same four levels
and nothing else, so the thirty call sites written against the older
`logger.warn(scope, message, data)` signature take this road too. A bare scope
becomes `app.<scope>` and a `data` object keeps its keys, `threadId` renamed to
`thread`, which is what puts a legacy line on `thread=`. There is one webview
log path.

`captureWebviewErrors()` runs once from `+layout.svelte` and adds three things:
`window.onerror` and `unhandledrejection` become `error` records at
`webview.unhandled`, keeping the first three stack frames rather than twenty
`file:///` URLs of bundled chunks; and `console.error` and `console.warn` are
**mirrored** at their own level under `webview.console`. Mirrored, not replaced:
replacing the console costs the devtools their source location, which is the one
thing a console line is good for.

The bus is reached through `backend().logs`, which is `write`, `tail`, `query`,
`level` and `subscribe` on both transports: `invoke` on the desktop, the
`logs.*` RPCs on a `boite-server`. `subscribe` hands back its unsubscribe and
tells the host to stop pushing when the last handler leaves.

Live records reach the desktop as a Tauri event, `log://record`, batched at
fifty records or 250 ms, the same numbers the server coalesces on, and for the
same reason: one event per record would put the emit on the log's own write
path. The `boite_core::log` subscriber clones the record onto a channel and
returns; a thread drains it (`src-tauri/src/log_feed.rs`). Nothing is emitted
until a `logs.subscribe` turns the feed on, so a window with the Logs section
closed costs the log nothing.

## The Logs section

Settings, and three bus calls. It opens on `tail` (200 records out of this
host's ring, instant, no file read), reads anything older through `query` with
`until`, and appends live while Follow is on.

**The filters go into the call, never over the answer.** Level, host, thread and
text are sent, so a needle finds a record that is in the file and not in the
ring; the panel this replaced filtered an array it had already downloaded, which
meant "search the log" only ever searched the last thousand lines of it.

A record draws its time in local hours, its level as a chip in the same warning
and danger colours as the rest of the app, and its `thread` as a short id that
filters the list down to that terminal, with the thread's own label under the
pointer when the row still exists.

## What is logged today

- Every command the bus refuses or fails, once, at the codec, at `warn`, with
  the method, plus the thread and the device on the server, which knows both.
- Every RPC handler that fails on the server, at `warn`, with the device.
- Every PTY spawned and every PTY that exited, at `info`, with the thread and
  the pid.
- Everything the desktop already wrote through `logging::append_app_log`, and
  every panic.
- Everything the window writes through `logger` in
  `shared/services/logger.svelte.ts`, at `app.<scope>`, with the `thread` where
  the call site has one.
- Every `backend()` call the window makes that refuses, at `warn`, with the
  method, from the one door each transport routes through (`backend/tauri/ipc.ts`
  and `Socket.rpc`). Quiet for five seconds per method and reason: a command
  that fails once fails again, and a panel on a timer would otherwise write one
  message until the disk filled.
- Every pane opened and closed, at `debug`, with its kind.
- Every thread created, settled and deleted, at `info`, with the `thread`.
- The remote link connecting, disconnecting and reconnecting, at `info`, with
  the boite it was talking to.
- Every toast raised, at `info`, whatever its kind: an `error` toast is a
  failure the app already handled, and the line saying why is above it.
- A thread's session binding and every status change, at `debug`, with the
  `thread`, from `Store::update_thread_field`, the one write every host makes.
- Approvals opened and resolved, at `info`, with the `thread` and the `request`.
- Orchestrator dispatches queued, drained and expired, at `info`, with the
  target `thread`.
