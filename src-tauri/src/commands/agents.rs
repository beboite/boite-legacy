//! Wiring an agent to Boite, which happens in config files rather than in code.
//!
//! Every agent reads a different file in a different place, and none of them
//! has an API for "add this server". So this reads what is there, says whether
//! Boite is already in it, and writes the line when asked.
//!
//! Nothing here grants anything. The credential an agent ends up holding is
//! minted at spawn (`crate::agent_api`), and a config file only ever names the
//! shim and the file to read it from.
