//! This app's door onto the pilot runtime, and the sink behind it.
//!
//! A codec like every other file beside it for the calls, plus the one thing
//! only a host can own: the [`boite_pilot::Runtime`] itself, the sink that
//! projects what it emits, and the 30 ms tick that coalesces text deltas before
//! they reach the window.
//!
//! The runtime is built lazily, for the same reason [`super::records::Rows`] is:
//! the schema belongs to `tauri-plugin-sql` and is applied from the frontend, so
//! anything that opens the database during `setup` opens it before the
//! migrations have run.
