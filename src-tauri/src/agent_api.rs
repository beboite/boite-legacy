//! This app's half of the agent endpoint.
//!
//! The routes and their behaviour live in `boite-agent-api`, shared with the
//! server. What is here is what a desktop app genuinely does differently: it
//! hands a request to its own webview rather than to whatever devices happen to
//! be connected, it pulses the sidebar so the user can see an agent reaching in,
//! and it writes a credentials file per project for agents it cannot hand
//! anything at launch.
//!
//! Bound to loopback. That narrowness is the whole security argument: the
//! dev-only `mcp-bridge` could already do this through `invoke_tauri`, which is
//! exactly why it cannot ship: a door that does everything cannot be defended.
//!
//! Who may ask for what is `boite_agent_api::auth`, and it is the same on both
//! hosts. An agent Boite launched signs with a key minted for its thread; an
//! agent registered from a credentials file presents a token derived for one
//! project and cannot reach another. The desktop used to accept a third thing,
//! a working directory, with the project resolved to whichever one contained it,
//! and that is gone.
