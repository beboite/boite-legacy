//! The desktop's half of the log.
//!
//! Everything that used to be here, the JSON format, the redaction, the
//! rotation, the bounded tail read, is now `boite_core::log`, because the
//! desktop is one host of four and a rule written on this side never reached
//! `boite-server`, `boite-mcp` or the webview. What is left is what only this
//! process can answer: where Tauri puts the log directory, and the shape the
//! diagnostics panel already reads.
//!
//! The public functions kept their names and signatures on purpose. Half of
//! `src-tauri` calls them, and turning that into a sweep would have put the
//! change and the risk in one commit.
