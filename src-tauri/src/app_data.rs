//! Moves the directories left behind when the bundle identifier changed.
//!
//! The identifier decides `app_data_dir()`, so renaming it orphans every
//! existing install's database, scrollback and window state in the old folder.
//! This runs before anything opens the database, moves what is there, and never
//! deletes anything it did not successfully move.
//!
//! "Before anything opens the database" is the load-bearing part, and it is why
//! this runs ahead of `tauri::Builder` rather than from the app's `setup` hook.
//! Plugin setup hooks run first, and `tauri.conf.json` preloads `sqlite:boite.db`
//! for the frontend's `Database.get`: by the time an app-level hook is called,
//! the sql plugin has already created an empty database at the new identifier.
//! The migration then found a database there, refused to overwrite it, and left
//! a real install stranded in the old directory. That shipped in 1.0.0.
//!
//! Two identifiers came before the current one, so this walks a chain and not a
//! pair: `dev.boite.app` up to 1.0.0, `com.boite.desktop` up to 1.3.4,
//! `com.boite.legacy` from 1.4.0. Each predecessor migrates into the current
//! identifier, most recent first, and the never-clobber rule settles the rest:
//! once `com.boite.desktop` has moved in, `dev.boite.app` finds a database at
//! the destination and is kept where it is.
//!
//! The data directory is not the only thing an identifier names. The webview
//! keeps the frontend's `localStorage` (pane layouts, device settings, thread
//! renames) somewhere else entirely, under the identifier too: in
//! `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<id>` on Windows, next to the logs, and in
//! `~/Library/WebKit/<id>` on macOS. Those move as well, best effort. Losing
//! them costs a layout, and no failure there is worth refusing to start over.
