//! The stdio door to the Boite MCP server.
//!
//! It holds no configuration of its own. Boite stamps `BOITE_MCP_URL`,
//! `BOITE_KEY_FILE` and `BOITE_THREAD_ID` into every PTY it spawns, so this
//! reads its whole identity from the environment. Launched anywhere else, those
//! variables are absent and it refuses to start, which is the point: an agent
//! outside Boite has nothing to present.
//!
//! The key arrives as a path rather than a value, because an environment is
//! something a terminal prints: `BOITE_TOKEN` put a credential into the output
//! of any `env` an agent typed, and that output is kept and replayed.
//!
//! What goes over the socket is a signature, never the key. Each request is
//! signed for its own method, path, thread, timestamp and body, so a request
//! captured anywhere is worth nothing on its own and one thread cannot speak
//! for another. See `boite_identity`.
//!
//! The same binary serves the desktop app and `boite-server`; only the URL in
//! the environment differs, so a remote workspace needs no separate shim.
//!
//! The protocol itself, both the handshake era and the stateless 2026-07-28
//! era, lives in `boite_mcp::rpc` and is shared with the `/mcp` HTTP route:
//! this file is only the loop that feeds it lines.
