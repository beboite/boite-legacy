//! The Boite MCP implementation, shared by its two doors.
//!
//! The stdio shim (`main.rs`) and the agent endpoint's `/mcp` route serve the
//! same tools to the same kind of caller, and until this library existed the
//! only way to have both was to write the protocol twice. What lives here is
//! everything transport-agnostic: the JSON-RPC engine with both protocol eras
//! in it (`rpc`), the tool list (`tools`), the dispatch from a tool name to a
//! workspace call (`call`), and the TOON the answers go out in (`toon`,
//! `render`). What stays outside is how a request reaches the workspace: the
//! shim signs HTTP over loopback (`host`, `http`), the server route dispatches
//! in-process, and both say so through one trait (`backend::Backend`).
