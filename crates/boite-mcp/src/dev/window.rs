//! The isolated dev window as a process this shim owns.
//!
//! `bun run dev:isolated` is a build and then an app: vite on port 1430,
//! `tauri dev` compiling `src-tauri` in debug, and finally a "Boite Dev"
//! window under the `dev.boite.dev` identifier with its own database. Cold,
//! the cargo build alone is minutes, which is why `start` waits with a ten
//! minute deadline and why `status` distinguishes `building` from `up`.
//!
//! Two rules hold the stop, both from `AGENTS.md`:
//!
//! 1. **Only the pid captured at spawn.** Never a name, never a pattern: this
//!    worktree's path and the word "boite" are in the argv of the user's own
//!    threads and of the app drawing them.
//! 2. **The tree, not the pid.** `bun` spawns `tauri`, which spawns `cargo`,
//!    which spawns the app; killing the pid alone leaves the rest compiling.
//!    A `boite_core::job::Job` with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` holds all of it, and
//!    closing that handle is the stop.
