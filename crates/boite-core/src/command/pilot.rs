//! The `pilot.*` domain: threads driven by protocol rather than by a PTY.
//!
//! Same shape as every other domain, with one difference the whole design
//! turns on: the work is async and `boite-core` takes no executor. So this file
//! does what a bus does and stops there: decode, declare what the call needs,
//! check the caller's grant and the roots of the thread's own directory, read
//! the row and build the [`boite_pilot::OpenSpec`] out of it, and hands the
//! host a [`PilotReady`]. The host owns the tokio runtime and runs it through
//! [`crate::pilot_host::execute`], which is the same shape as `pulse_waiters`
//! and `child_pid`: a capability the bus validates and a resource only a host
//! has.
//!
//! `Host::pilot()` answers `None` on a host with no runtime, a test, a headless
//! CLI, and every method here refuses with that sentence rather than pretending
//! a thread has a session.
