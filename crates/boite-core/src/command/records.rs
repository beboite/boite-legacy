//! The rows a workspace is made of: projects, threads, todos, settings.
//!
//! The last domain that was read two ways. The server had fifteen hand-written
//! RPC arms over `Store`; the desktop had eight SQL statements in
//! `src/lib/backend/tauri/db.ts`, sent straight from the webview through
//! tauri-plugin-sql. One schema, two readers, and nothing that could notice when
//! they stopped agreeing.
//!
//! They had already stopped. [`Records::ThreadCreate`] carries the difference:
//! the server refuses to take a client's word for a thread's runtime state and
//! the desktop did not, so a stale snapshot in the window could put `running`
//! back on a thread whose process had ended. The desktop knew about the shape of
//! the problem, `updateThreadTitle` exists precisely because a whole-row
//! `REPLACE` clobbers concurrent writes, and had solved it for one column.
//!
//! Reading across those rows lives here too. [`Records::Search`] answers over
//! the todos and the journal at once, and the store is what it needs; that it
//! also scans the transcripts is a second source on the same answer rather than
//! a reason for a domain of its own.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here: the side effects each host wraps around
//! these. The server broadcasts an `AppEvent`, refreshes its roots and kills a
//! PTY; the desktop removes a key file. Those are things a host does about a
//! row changing, not the row changing, and a bus that owned them would need a
//! `Host` method per host quirk.
