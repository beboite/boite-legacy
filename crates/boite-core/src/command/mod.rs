//! One named surface for what a client may ask Boite to do.
//!
//! Boite has two front doors: Tauri commands on the desktop and a WebSocket RPC
//! on the server. Until this module existed, each one carried its own copy of
//! every capability, the same scope check, the same call into the domain, the
//! same refusal worded twice, and nothing checked that the two copies agreed.
//! Every divergence the audit found was a capability that existed on one side
//! only, or a boundary applied on one side only.
//!
//! So a capability is a value here, and the two front doors are codecs over it:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Tauri command  ─┐                                     ┌─ grant   who is asking
//!                   ├─ Command ── Ready ── run() ── Value ┼─ host    what it may reach
//!   WebSocket RPC  ─┘                                     └─ run()   the work
//! ```
//!
//! [`Command::prepare`] is the only thing that touches the [`Host`] or the
//! caller's [`Grant`], and [`Ready`] is the only thing that can be run. That is
//! not decoration: it makes "was this checked" a question with exactly one
//! answer per command, instead of a line a new command can forget to copy. The
//! test at the bottom of `command/git.rs` walks every command in the surface and
//! asserts that none of them prepares outside the registered roots; the one at
//! the bottom of this file asserts that every one of them declares what it
//! needs.
//!
//! `Ready` is deliberately free of the host and of any lifetime, so a transport
//! can hand it to its own blocking pool. `boite-core` takes no async runtime and
//! this module does not change that: `run` blocks, and each transport wraps it
//! in whatever it already uses.
