//! The orchestration surface: the pulse, the orchestrator conversation, and
//! the dispatch queue.
//!
//! Small on purpose, and grown phase by phase. Phase 1 brought a worker's
//! phase transitions written down (`conduct.record`), read back with an
//! optional wait (`conduct.pulse`), and the durable chat the user and the
//! orchestrator share (`orchestrator.post` / `orchestrator.say` /
//! `orchestrator.messages`). Phase 3 adds the dispatch queue: a dispatch is a
//! row, never a byte (`crate::reply` forbids typing from the bus, on purpose,
//! and this does not go around it). `thread.dispatch` queues the line, the
//! device that owns the target PTY drains and types it (`dispatch.drain`,
//! guards in `crate::orchestrator::dispatch`), and reports what happened
//! (`dispatch.settle`). `thread.acceptDispatch` is the user's mute switch.
//!
//! The wait is the part with rules. `conduct.pulse` long-polls the ring through
//! `crate::pulse::Waiters`, which caps the timeout at 120 s, allows one live
//! wait per calling thread (a second one supersedes the first, named
//! `PULSE_SUPERSEDED`), and eight per process (`PULSE_BUSY`). A host that wires
//! no waiters — a test, the desktop window today — answers immediately with
//! `timedOut: true`, which is honest: nothing was waited on.
