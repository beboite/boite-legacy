//! One log, across the three Rust hosts and the webview.
//!
//! Before this module there were two logs and neither answered a question: the
//! desktop wrote `app.log`, a flat `{tsMs, level, source, message}` with no way
//! to say which thread a line belonged to, and `boite-server` printed
//! `tracing` events to a stderr nobody keeps. `boite-mcp` wrote nothing at all.
//! An agent asked "what happened to thread X" had three places to look, two of
//! which do not name a thread.
//!
//! So the format is one [`Record`] per line of JSON, the ids that answer that
//! question are top level rather than buried in `fields`, and every host writes
//! its own file in one directory so a reader merges them on one clock.
//!
//! Rust code logs through the `tracing` macros with those names as fields
//! (`tracing::info!(thread = %id, "pty.spawned")`). [`layer`] turns each event
//! into a record, lifting `thread`, `turn`, `request` and `device` out of the
//! event or out of any span enclosing it, so a caller that opened
//! `bus.call{method, thread}` never repeats the thread on the events inside it.
//!
//! This crate takes no async runtime, and this module does not change that: a
//! write is a `Mutex` and a `writeln!`, on whichever thread logged.
