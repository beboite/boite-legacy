//! What one pilot event does to the rows.
//!
//! The crate owns the child processes and emits canonical events; this module
//! is the only thing that turns one of those into a journal row, a timeline
//! item, an approval card or a column on `threads`. Synchronous and free of any
//! executor, so both hosts call it from whatever thread the sink runs on and
//! `boite-core` keeps taking no async runtime.
//!
//! Two rules the shape enforces rather than documents:
//!
//! - **A text delta is never written.** `item.delta` appends to a
//!   [`DeltaBuffer`] the host keeps in memory and nothing else; the body that
//!   lands on the row is the one `item.completed` carries, falling back to the
//!   buffer when the driver completed an item without repeating its text.
//! - **What to push is the projection's answer, not the caller's guess.**
//!   [`Projection`] says whether the event goes to subscribers and whether the
//!   `threads` row changed enough for a `thread.updated`, so the desktop and
//!   the server cannot drift on when a sidebar refreshes.
