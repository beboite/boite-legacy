//! already has. What it buys is that the desktop and the server run a
//! `pilot.turn.start` through the same twenty lines, instead of two copies that
//! drift on what a model selection does or on when `threads.session_id` is
//! written.
//!
//! The projection is deliberately not here: an event arrives on the driver's
//! own task, not on the call that caused it, so the sink runs
//! [`crate::pilot::project`] and this module only answers the call.
