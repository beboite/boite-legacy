//! Asking `fast-mcp-ssh` which version is on this machine.
//!
//! That binary is [klNuno/fast-mcp-ssh](https://github.com/klNuno/fast-mcp-ssh),
//! an MCP server the agents reach their machines through. Boite neither starts
//! it nor reads its config: a thread's own MCP client owns that. The plugins
//! panel only has to tell an install from an update, and that is one question.
//!
//! It runs where the agents run, which for a remote boite is the server. A
//! desktop asking its own PATH would answer for the wrong machine.
