//! Asking `fastpick` what a thread could be launched on.
//!
//! fastpick is a separate tool that owns the awkward half of running an agent against a
//! third-party endpoint: the key files, the local proxy it has to start, the machine it has
//! to wake, and the environment each agent wants that setup expressed in. Boite does not
//! reimplement any of that. It asks for the choices, draws them in its own menu, and then
//! launches `fastpick --harness <h> --provider <p> --model <m>` as the thread's command.
//!
//! The answer is passed through as the raw JSON document fastpick printed, deliberately.
//! Parsing it into structs here would mean tracking its schema in two languages and a boite
//! release for every field it grows; the frontend types the shape it actually reads, and
//! the payload carries a `schema` number for when that stops being enough.
//!
//! This runs where the agents run, which for a remote boite is the server. That is the
//! whole reason the key never has to travel: fastpick reads it on the machine that spawns
//! the PTY, and no part of it reaches whatever device is drawing the menu.
