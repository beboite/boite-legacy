//! What the agents left on disk, read back.
//!
//! Every coding agent keeps its own record of a conversation somewhere on the
//! machine, in its own format, under its own idea of where a project lives.
//! Boite reads nine of them so a terminal can come back on the session it was
//! on, and so the sidebar can say what each agent is doing right now.
//!
//! One file per store, because they have nothing in common but the questions
//! asked of them:
//!
//! - [`claude`] is the only one Boite can also *drive*: it holds a live
//!   registry with pids in it, so a session can be stopped and a transcript can
//!   be carried to a new folder.
//! - [`codex`] keeps a rollout log, which is what its turn state is read from.
//! - [`opencode`] keeps a sqlite database of messages.
//! - [`editors`] is the six that Boite can only ever read for *which*
//!   conversation: copilot, cursor, antigravity, grok, hermes and pi. Grok is
//!   the exception on the turn: its `updates.jsonl` brackets one the way a
//!   codex rollout does, so it also contributes to the sidebar's activity
//!   dot. The other five still do not.
//!
//! What stays here is what more than one of them needs, and the vocabulary they
//! all answer in: [`SessionHit`], [`AgentTurn`], [`TurnQuery`],
//! [`DeclaredTurn`]. The submodules can see it because a private item in a
//! parent module is visible to its descendants, which is why this split is a
//! move rather than a rewrite.
//!
//! Nothing here decides *which* session a thread should resume. That is
//! `command::sessions`, which takes the hit and compares it against what the
//! caller already holds.
