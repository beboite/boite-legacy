//! This server's half of the agent endpoint.
//!
//! The routes and their behaviour live in `boite-agent-api`, shared with the
//! desktop. What is here is what a server genuinely does differently: it hands a
//! request to whatever devices are connected rather than to a webview it owns,
//! it knows there may be none, and it takes its port from the OS on loopback.
//!
//! It gets its own listener rather than routes on the main router, and its own
//! secret. The main server may be bound to a routable interface, that is the
//! whole point of a remote workspace, and nothing here belongs on a network.
//! The client token and this secret are also different things: a device that can
//! drive the workspace is not the same principal as an agent that may append to
//! a checklist.
