//! The server's half of the pilot runtime: the sink and its coalescing tick.
//!
//! The calls themselves are `rpc.rs` over `boite_core::pilot_host`, the way
//! every other domain is. What is here is what only a host can own: the
//! [`Runtime`], the sink that projects what it emits onto the rows, and the
//! 30 ms tick that joins text deltas before they reach a socket.
//!
//! Built before [`AppState`], because the state holds the runtime: the sink
//! needs the store and the event channel and nothing else, and both exist by
//! then.
