//! What a method needs, and the only way to reach a handler.
//!
//! Holding a socket used to be authorisation to call everything on it. The fix
//! is not a line at the top of each arm in `rpc.rs`, that is a line a new arm
//! forgets, but a type. [`Authorized`] carries a method and its parameters,
//! its fields are private, and [`Authorized::check`] is its only constructor.
//! `rpc::dispatch` takes one. A transport therefore cannot dispatch work it did
//! not first put through the scope check, in the same way `command::Ready` is
//! the only thing that can be run and `boite_agent_api`'s `Caller` is the only
//! thing a handler can be handed.
//!
//! ## The table is total, and it fails closed
//!
//! [`required`] answers for every method this server serves, in two halves:
//!
//! - the sixty-odd commands on the bus answer from their own declared
//!   [`Capability`], read by name out of `boite_core::command::capabilities`.
//!   There is no second copy to keep in step, so a capability that changes
//!   there changes the device check with it;
//! - everything `rpc.rs` still serves itself, the PTY registry, push
//!   subscriptions, approvals, search, the snapshot, pairing, is in
//!   [`NON_BUS`], which is this file's equivalent of T3 Code's
//!   `RPC_REQUIRED_SCOPES`.
//!
//! A method in neither is **unknown**, not unrestricted. So an arm added to
//! `rpc.rs` without an entry here is dead rather than open, which is the
//! failure direction worth having: the smoke suite says so loudly, and nothing
//! ships accidentally reachable by a read-only phone.

/// it carry no workspace state at all, and a device that cannot ask who it is
/// talking to cannot draw a connection banner.
///
/// The three that matter, and why they are not what a name would suggest:
///
/// - `thread.spawn`, `thread.resize`, `thread.kill`, `thread.attach` and the
///   binary input frame are [`Scope::Terminal`], never [`Scope::Write`]. A PTY
///   is arbitrary code on the machine rather than a change to a project, and a
///   read-only device reaching one is the hole this whole file exists to close.
/// - `agent.claimRequest` is [`Scope::Approve`]: claiming means volunteering to
///   carry out what an agent asked for, and a device that takes a claim and
///   cannot act on it has swallowed the request for every other device.
/// - `notify.test` is [`Scope::Admin`]. It makes this server POST somewhere of
///   the operator's choosing, which is not a read.
///
/// `pairing.create` is the one entry this table does not finish on its own.
/// Admin says the device may invite another; it does not say *what* it may
/// invite it with, and an invitation carrying more than its author holds is a
/// way to grant yourself a scope. The arm clamps with
