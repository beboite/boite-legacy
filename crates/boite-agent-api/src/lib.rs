//! The door an agent uses to reach its own workspace.
//!
//! Ten routes, and until this crate existed there were two hand-kept copies of
//! them: one in the desktop app, one in the server. Nine of the eleven
//! verb-and-route pairs had drifted apart. One side refused a request no device
//! could carry out and the other answered success; one side wrote every mutation
//! to the project's log and the other wrote nothing; one side ran three `git`
//! processes off the async runtime and the other ran them on it. None of that
//! was a decision: the server binary is a crate nothing can depend on, so the
//! second copy was the only way to have the feature at all.
//!
//! What differs between the two hosts is real and small: where a request goes
//! once it is understood, and who else is watching. That is the [`Workspace`]
//! trait. Everything else, the token check, who the caller is, what a refusal
//! says, what lands in the log, is here, once.
