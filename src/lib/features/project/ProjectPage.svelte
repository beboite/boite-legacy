   * What a project looks like when you click it.
   *
   * It used to look like nothing: selecting a project changed which threads the
   * sidebar expanded and left the main area on a list of keyboard shortcuts.
   * This is the page that answers "what is going on here, and what do I want to
   * do about it".
   *
   * The shortcut bar is the page's own rather than the terminal view's. This
   * page covers the whole main area, so for as long as it was on screen the bar
   * was behind it — a project page with no way to start anything in the project
   * it was describing. Worktrees used to be a second tab up here and are a card
   * on the overview now: two tabs were two clicks to see one screen's worth of
   * information, and the room the chat pane once needed is free.
