       three are what is happening. The list itself, not a summary of it: this
       card used to be six truncated titles with an input under them, which is
       the right shape only while a docked column is one click away. There is
       no column any more, so this is a full todo surface, the same component
       the pane draws, with the same tick, confirm, edit, drag and delete on
       every card. Claimed is still called out separately: it means an agent
       says it is done and only the user can confirm that. -->
