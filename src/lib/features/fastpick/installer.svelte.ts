 * output could go was a terminal, and it cost more than it bought: a pane, a
 * sidebar row and a detached worktree, all for a command that installs a binary
 * and belongs to no repository, and the user was left to work out on their own
 * whether the thing they came to install was now installed. The answer to that
 * question lives in the panel that asked it.
 *
 * Still a real PTY underneath, because the thing being watched may be a
 * compiler: it wants a terminal to size its output to, its failures are its own
 * error text and nothing else, and it has to be killable. What changes is only
 * where the bytes are drawn.
 *
 * Only the first install is a compiler now. `update` hands the job to fastpick,
 * which fetches a signed release, so it is seconds and needs no toolchain.
