/**
 * The one way anything opens a pane.
 *
 * Splitting used to have exactly one entry point in the whole app, drag a
 * thread row from the sidebar onto a live terminal, with no shortcut, no
 * palette command, no menu item and no button. That is the other half of why
 * nobody used it: the feature worked, and could not be found. Everything that
 * wants a pane now comes through here: the keyboard, the palette, the titlebar,
 * and the MCP verb an agent calls to show what it just did.
 *
 * `ratio` is a share of the group, so a caller that wants a column says so with
 * `panelRatio()` rather than a number: 0.35 of a 2560px window is 900px of git
 * panel, where the rail this replaced was 320px whatever the screen.
 *
 * `anchor` is for the one caller that knows better than the screen does: an
 * agent asking for a pane beside its own terminal, which is very often not the
 * terminal the user is reading. Given one, **nothing here moves the view**:
 * no active thread, no selected project, no switch away from the project page.
 * The pane appears where it belongs and waits there, since every group stays
 * mounted whether or not it is the one being drawn.
