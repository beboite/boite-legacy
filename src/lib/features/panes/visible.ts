 * finish loading, keep its driver attached and answer questions while the
 * window is showing something else entirely. It also means "the pane exists"
 * and "the pane is on the screen" are two different questions, and the layout
 * tree answers neither: a hidden group's leaves are laid out at the same
 * rectangles as the visible one's.
 *
 * So the page marks its groups and this reads the mark. Two callers: the
 * window's description of itself, which would otherwise report a pane nobody
 * can see as visible, and the screenshot, which photographs a rectangle of the
 * window and would otherwise hand back whatever is drawn over the pane.
