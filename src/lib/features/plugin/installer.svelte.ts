/**
 * Installing a plugin's CLI without leaving the settings panel.

 * output could go was a terminal, and it cost more than it bought: a pane, a
 * sidebar row and a detached worktree, all for a command that installs a binary
 * and belongs to no repository, and the user was left to work out on their own
 * whether the thing they came to install was now installed. The answer to that
 * question lives in the panel that asked it.
 *
 * Still a real PTY underneath, because the thing being watched may be a
 * compiler: it wants a terminal to size its output to, its failures are its own
 * error text and nothing else, and it has to be killable. What changes is only
 * where the bytes are drawn.
 *
 * Every action here is cargo, install and update alike, so all three are builds
 * and all three are watched the same way. One instance per plugin: they hold a
 * PTY and a thread id, and two cards sharing one would draw the same log twice.

 * of starting a second `cargo install` beside the first. Per plugin rather than
 * one for all of them: two cards installing at once are two builds, and a
