  /**
   * What the user says, and everything they can change about who answers it.
   *
   * One rounded surface: the box on top, then a row of chips saying who answers
   * and under what rules, with the send on the right. Model, mode and effort are
   * three chips of the same shape rather than a chip beside a segmented control,
   * because they are three settings of one sentence and the eye should not have
   * to learn two widgets to read it. Effort is drawn only where a driver
   * declares levels: a chip reading "default" is a control that controls
   * nothing, and the menu used to carry one.
   *
   * The decisions are `keys.ts` and `slash.ts` and have no DOM in them; what is
   * here is the textarea, the growth, and the two calls.
   *
   * Sending during a turn calls `startTurn` exactly as it does when the thread
   * is idle: the backend steers a turn already in flight, so a composer that
   * queued would be a second idea of the conversation kept somewhere the
   * timeline cannot see it. The line above the row says so, quietly and in
   * place, because a modal asking "steer or queue?" is a question the backend
   * already answered.
   *
   * The send button stays drawn while a turn runs rather than being replaced:
   * steering is exactly what it does then, and the stop takes the primary slot
   * beside it. A composer whose only button became Stop would make steering a
   * keyboard-only feature, which is the phone with no way in.
