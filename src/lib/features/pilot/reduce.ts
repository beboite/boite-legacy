/**
 * What one pilot event does to a thread's timeline, with no Svelte in it.
 *
 * The store owns the reactivity and the frame budget; this owns the reduction,
 * which is the half worth testing. A client arriving mid-turn reads items by
 * cursor and then subscribes, so the same functions have to build a state out
 * of stored rows and out of live events and land on the same thing. That is why
 * [`fromRows`] and [`reduce`] write into one shape rather than two.
 *
 * Mutating on purpose. A turn of two hundred deltas would otherwise copy the
 * item array two hundred times, and the store already knows when to hand the
 * result to `$state`.
