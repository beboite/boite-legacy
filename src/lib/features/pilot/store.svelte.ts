 * three things reactivity costs: when a delta reaches `$state`, when a
 * subscription starts, and when both are dropped.
 *
 * The rule the shape enforces: **a delta never writes state.** Deltas land in a
 * buffer keyed by item, and one animation frame later the whole buffer is
 * applied and the thread's view is replaced once. A two hundred token turn is
 * one paint per frame rather than two hundred paints, which is the render
 * budget `docs/pilot.md` writes down.
