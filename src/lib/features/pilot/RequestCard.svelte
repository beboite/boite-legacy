  /**
   * One open question, answered where it is.
   *
   * The one card in the pane that has to be seen: a foreground border and a
   * band of surface-2 while it is open, because everything else on the timeline
   * is a hairline on the background and a question that read like a tool call
   * is a thread stopped for a reason nobody noticed.
   *
   * The buttons are the driver's own options in the driver's own order, and
   * their values go back untouched: `pilot.request.respond` maps them on the
   * machine holding the process (`boite_core::pilot::answer_of_option`), which
   * is the one place that may decide a string means "run it". A card that built
   * its own vocabulary would be a second idea of what the user agreed to. The
   * first option is the primary one for the same reason: the driver put the
   * safe answer where it wanted it, and reordering is boite deciding for it.
   *
   * Enter takes the first option and Escape the last, which is the only pair a
   * card can bind without reading the driver's vocabulary. Bound on the card
   * rather than on the window: two questions can be up at once, and a key that
   * answered whichever was rendered last would answer the wrong one.
   *
   * The same component in two places: the pane's timeline and the approvals
   * dock, `compact` being the difference. A dock card that looked different
   * from the one in the pane would be a second thing to learn about the same
   * question.
