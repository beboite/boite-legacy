/**
 * Who is working, recomputed from scratch twice a second.
 *
 * Two things about this file used to be wrong in the same way, and both showed
 * up as an agent that had finished and stayed lit until the user clicked it:
 *
 * The status was latched, not measured. A working signal stamped a timestamp
 * and the thread read as running until that stamp aged out, so "finished" was
 * only ever the absence of evidence, and the evidence came from a rolling
 * window of printed bytes that kept re-matching itself long after the turn
 * ended (see `working-detect.ts`). Nothing in the loop could ever conclude a
 * turn was over; it could only fail to notice it continuing.
 *
 * The loop itself was owned by the terminals. `acquire`/`release` ran off a
 * refcount of mounted `Terminal` components, so the sweep that demotes threads
 * only existed while at least one local pane was mounted. In dynamic mode, with
 * the boite's panes open and no local one, it did not run at all, and every
 * local thread kept whatever status it had when the last one closed. Clicking a
 * project mounted a pane, which restarted the sweep, which is why clicking is
 * what repaired it.
 *
 * So: one ticker for the lifetime of the window, and every pass answers "is
 * this thread working" from live state only.
 *
 * One TTL survives, and only where there is no live state at all to read: a
 * thread whose pane is gone and whose agent declares nothing (`UNREAD_TTL_MS`).
 * That is not the old grace period on a working signal, it is the backstop that
 * keeps "no answer" from meaning "keep the last answer forever".

 * alone there is not "wrong for two seconds", it is wrong for the life of the
