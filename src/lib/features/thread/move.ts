/**
 * Moving a running conversation from one project to another.
 *
 * One machinery, two doors: the `thread_move` MCP tool an agent calls on
 * itself, and a thread card dragged onto another project. They both land here
 * so a move means the same thing however it was asked for.
 *
 * A thread is three things in three places — a row in the database, a live
 * process in a directory, and a transcript the CLI files somewhere of its own —
 * and a move has to take all three or it takes none. The transcript is the part
 * that is easy to miss: claude looks a session up under the directory it ran
 * in, so a thread that changes project silently loses `--resume` unless the
 * file follows it.
