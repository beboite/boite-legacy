 * Whether an agent is mid-turn, read off the rows it is repainting.
 *
 * The input is deliberately the emulator's live screen region and not the byte
 * stream. Detection used to run on a rolling 4000-character tail of everything
 * the PTY had printed, which answers a question about the recent past: an
 * `esc to interrupt` footer, or a `✻` from a thinking block, stayed in that
 * window long after the turn it belonged to ended, and every subsequent byte
 * the agent printed re-matched it and re-armed "running". That is the thread
 * that never stops working until you click it: clicking refits the terminal,
 * the agent repaints, and the stale evidence finally falls out of the window.
 *
 * Read off the screen instead, the same answer is level rather than latched:
 * the footer is on the rows or it is not, so `false` is as trustworthy as
 * `true` and nothing has to expire.

/**
 * The live region is the bottom block of rows with no gap in it, and this is
 * only the cap on how far up that block may reach.
 *
 * A fixed count was wrong. It was calibrated on a bare claude, whose spinner
 * sits four rows above the last one, and every row of chrome a user adds pushes
 * it further: a statusline, the auto-mode hint and a warning banner between them
 * put it eight rows up, outside a five-row window, and a visibly working agent
 * read as finished. Counting higher instead would walk into the transcript,
 * where a thinking block's `✻` bullet leads its line exactly the way a spinner
 * does.
 *
 * The gap is what separates the two, and every agent leaves one: chrome is drawn
 * as a block at the bottom of the screen with a blank row above it, and printed
 * output is on the far side of that row. So the block decides its own size and
 * this only stops a screen with no blank row left in it from being scanned whole.
