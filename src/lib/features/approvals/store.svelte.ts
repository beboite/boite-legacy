 * Questions the user has to answer, from wherever they come.

 * workspace database, which is what makes it survive the app being closed and
 * reach a second window. Anything the front end wants answered the same way,
 * without stealing focus, without a scrim, while the terminal underneath keeps
 * running, calls {@link ApprovalStore.ask} and gets a promise back.
 *
 * The difference from `shared/components/confirm.svelte.ts` is who is waiting.
 * A confirm dialog is the answer to something the user just did, so it owns the
 * screen until they answer. These arrive on their own schedule, so they queue
 * in a corner and the work underneath carries on.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything for a backend row: the dispatch that will run
 * lives in the database beside the request, so `decide` sends an id and a yes or
 * no and the host replays what was stored. A card that rebuilt the request from
 * what it was rendering would be a second idea of what the user agreed to.
