  /**
   * The todo list: the cards, everything you can do to one, the line that adds
   * the next one, and what is drawn when there are none.
   *
   * One component because the list has two homes and they used to disagree. The
   * pane and the project dashboard each drew their own input with their own
   * placeholder, and only one of the two put a failed save back in the box, so
   * whether a todo you typed survived a database error depended on which of the
   * two you had typed it into. The empty state was the visible half of the same
   * split: "nothing noted for this project" was on the dashboard twice, once
   * from this list and once from the docked column beside it.
   *
   * So everything about the list is here — ticking, confirming an agent's
   * claim, editing, reordering, deleting, handing a card to the terminal in
   * front, and adding one. What stays outside is what belongs to the surface
   * rather than to the list: the header naming the project, the eraser, the
   * agent-access section a column has room for and a card does not.
   *
   * `compact` is the dashboard card: the same list, capped so a project with
   * forty todos does not decide how tall the two cards beside it are.
