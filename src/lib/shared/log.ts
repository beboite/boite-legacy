/**
 * The webview's half of the log.
 *
 * `boite_core::log` owns the format, the files and the ring; the browser has
 * none of those, so a record produced here goes over the bus (`logs.write`) and
 * lands in whichever host answered. That is the whole reason this module
 * exists: on a phone talking to a `boite-server`, "what happened to thread X"
 * has to include what the window did, and a `console.log` nobody keeps is not
 * an answer.
 *
 * `services/logger.svelte.ts` is a shim over this module and nothing else, so
 * the thirty call sites written against the old signature take this road too.
 * There is one webview log path.
 *
 * Two things it is careful about, because both have bitten this codebase:
 *
 * - **Batched, never one call per line.** A busy second writes hundreds, and an
 *   IPC hop per line was measured as a couple of file writes a second forever
 *   for a thread that had simply got stuck. 500 ms or fifty records, whichever
 *   comes first, and the queue is flushed on `pagehide` so the last thing a
 *   window said before it went away is the thing that is kept.
 * - **It never logs about itself.** A flush that fails is dropped. Reporting it
 *   would put the report in the batch that just failed, and the next flush
 *   would carry the report of the flush before it.
