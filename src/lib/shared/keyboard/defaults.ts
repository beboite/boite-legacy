 * What Boite ships with. This used to be the whole shortcut system, a table of
 * closures in `+layout.svelte`; it is now the seed of the user's own set, and
 * `merge.ts` is what lands a newly added line here in an install that already
 * has rules.
 *
 * The clauses reproduce the scope ladder they replaced. It resolved one scope
 * top-down (`palette > modal > settings > editor > project > app`), so a rule
 * scoped to `app` was silent while any panel or overlay was up, and `!
 * overlayOpen` is that same sentence now that every layer is its own key.
