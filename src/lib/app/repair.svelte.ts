/**
 * What boot has to fix in rows an older Boite wrote.
 *
 * Three passes that run once, between the rows landing and the app being ready,
 * and none of them is about how the app works now. They were in the store next
 * to the methods that do, where the only thing they had in common was being
 * long.
 *
 * They share a shape worth keeping together: each finds rows carrying an answer
 * a past version gave, writes the answer this version would give, and never
 * fails boot over it. A repair that throws is worse than the state it was
 * repairing, because the state at least starts.
 *
 * Order matters and is set by the caller: `migrateWorktrees` has to follow
 * `syncRoots`, since the backend refuses a repository it has no root for, and
 * it has to land before a terminal mounts, since mounting is what spawns a PTY
 * in the directory it is about to move.

/**
 * Drops titles a past version let through and this one would refuse.
 *
 * The filter runs when a title arrives, so a name it did not know about yet,
 * `fastpick` announcing its own image path before the agent it launches gets to
 * speak, was written to the row and outlives the fix: the thread is idle, no new
 * title is coming, and the sidebar keeps showing an executable path until
 * someone renames it by hand. Widening the set has to reach the rows already
 * wearing the old answer.
 *
 * A name the user typed is left alone, and so is a remote row: the server owns
 * those titles and re-pushes them, so writing here would be undone anyway.
