/**
 * What a boite pushes, projected onto this client's rows.
 *
 * Remote only. The server owns thread runtime state there, so this is the one
 * place a status, a title or a row arrives from outside and the client's job is
 * to project it rather than to decide anything.
 *
 * **Why the remote path does not go through the store's setters.** They persist,
 * and persisting here would write the client's copy back over the state the
 * server owns. The cost of that is one thing having to be remembered twice, and
 * it has already been forgotten once: `noteStatusChange` lives in `setThreadStatus`
 * for the local path and has to be repeated here (with `projectId`, or a remote
 * turn stamps the thread and never the project), or a boite's threads would
 * never glow when they finish.
