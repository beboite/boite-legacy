/**
 * What an agent asked Boite to do to Boite.
 *
 * The MCP endpoint cannot carry any of this out itself. Moving a thread means
 * killing a PTY and opening a worktree; creating a project means writing rows
 * the store owns; spawning one means mounting a terminal. All of it lives here,
 * in the app, and the endpoint's whole job is to decide whether the request
 * makes sense and then say so.
 *
 * In `lib/app` rather than under a feature, which is where it used to sit: it
 * reaches into projects, threads, settings and notifications in the same
 * function, and being filed under `thread` made the one import it needs from
 * `project` into a cycle between the two.
 *
 * Which is why these arrive as an event rather than as the answer to an HTTP
 * call: two of the three kill the process that asked. The reply is written
 * while the agent is still alive to read a refusal, and the work happens after
 * it has gone.
