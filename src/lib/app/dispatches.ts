 * dispatch is a row until a device drains it. This file is that device. The
 * policy it applies is a mirror of `boite_core::orchestrator::dispatch::flush`
 * — same guards, same order, same reason words — because the desktop and the
 * headless server must not drift on when a line is allowed to land.
 *
 * Ownership is the sink: every mounted Terminal registers one, and a window
 * without the target's terminal leaves the row queued for the window that has
 * it. Settling is first-writer-wins on the boite, so two windows racing the
 * same line settle it once — and it happens after the write, never before, so
 * a row is only marked delivered by a device whose bytes actually left.
